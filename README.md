# eventcam-studio

eventcam-studio is a program which will interface with the [SilkyEvCam EvC3A](https://www.centuryarks.com/images/product/sensor/silkyevcam/SilkyEvCam-USB_Spec_Rev102.pdf) event-based camera and [Basler Dart daA3840-45uc](https://docs.baslerweb.com/daa3840-45uc) frame-based camera.

## How to clone this repository

If you're reading this message, you have access to this private repository! Yipeee! ðŸŽ‰

Try cloning this repository by opening a command prompt window with the following command:

`$ git clone https://github.com/GavinSadler/eventcam-studio.git`

If you got some sort of error saying `git is an unrecognized command`, you probably need to install git. Navigate to [this website](https://gitforwindows.org/)
and install git onto your computer.

You may not simply be able to `git clone` this repository onto your machine, as it is a private repo. One solution is to create a set of SSH keys on
your machine and add them to your Github account. Github already has a few guides on this topic, which you can read in the following articles:

[Check to see if you have existing SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)\
[Generate new SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)\
[Add SSH keys to your Github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

After doing this, try cloning the repository again.

## Required software

In order to build this software, you will need several items:
- A C++ compiler
- An IDE
- A C++ package manager (I'm going to recommend vcpkg)
- Metavision's SDK
- Bassler's SDK
- Event-camera driver

### C++ compiler and IDE

Visual Studio (Not Visual Studio Code) is the preferred IDE for C++ development. If you would rather use VSCode, go right ahead, but you will still need to
install a C++ compiler on your system. Luckily, we can install both of these with the Visual Studio Installer. Download it here:

[You can download both here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/)

When running the Visual Studio Installer, make sure that you select `Desktop development with C++` as this package specifically installs the C++ compiler.

### C++ package manager

vcpkg is a simple to use package manager for Windows and makes downloading dependencies and libraries much easier. [You can find more information about vcpkg here](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), as well as their [suggested installation process here](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-start-windows). I will provide install details here as well.

First, open a command prompt, `cd` to your C drive, and clone the vcpkg repository:\
_Hint: cd means change directory, it is like moving around between folders on your computer_

`$ cd C:\`\
`$ git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg `

Then, you have to `cd` into the vcpkg folder and initialize the vcpkg environment with the following commands:

`$ cd vcpkg`\
`$ bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`

#### Adding vcpkg to your PATH

One thing you may want to do is add vcpkg to your PATH environment variable. This will make it so you do not have to navigate to the vcpkg folder every time you
want to use vcpkg. To do this:

1. Go to Windows's settings and search for environment variables. You should find an option that says `Edit the system environment variables`. Click this and a
   dialog should pop up
2. Click the button near the bottom that says `Environment Variables...`. A new dialog should pop up that allows you to edit the environment variables on your
   system.
3. Scroll through the System Environment Variables list and find the environment variable labeled `Path`, select it, and click `Edit...` A new dialog will pop
   up that allows you to add a new entry into the `Path` environment variable.
4. Enter the directory of your vcpkg installation. If you followed the installation instructions above, it should be `C:\vcpkg`.
5. Click `Ok` on all of the dialog boxes to close them all out

To test to see if this worked, open a new command prompt and type `vcpkg`. If you get a long list of options, congradulation! vcpkg has been installed on your
computer and added to your path! If you get something along the lines of `vcpkg is an unrecongized command`, it _might_ be installed but not in your Path. 

### Metavision SDK, event-camera driver, and Baslar's Pylon SDK

Both SDKs and the event-camera driver can be downloaded and installed from their respective websites:

[Metavision SDK (Make sure to download version 4.4.0 or greater!)](https://files.prophesee.ai/share/dists/public/windows/baiTh5si/)
[SilkyEvCam EvC3A driver (This is required to interface with our specific camera)](https://centuryarks.com/en/download/)
[Basler's Pylon SDK (Download the latest version of the software suite)](https://www2.baslerweb.com/en/downloads/software-downloads/)
