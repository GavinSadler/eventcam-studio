## Required software

In order to build this software, you will need several items:
- A C++ compiler
- An IDE
- Metavision's SDK
- Bassler's SDK
- Event-camera driver

### C++ compiler and IDE

Visual Studio (Not Visual Studio Code) is the preferred IDE for C++ development. If you would rather use VSCode, go right ahead, but you will still need to
install a C++ compiler on your system. Luckily, we can install both of these with the Visual Studio Installer. Download it here:

[You can download both here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/)

When running the Visual Studio Installer, make sure that you select `Desktop development with C++` as this package specifically installs the C++ compiler.

### Metavision SDK, event-camera driver, and Baslar's Pylon SDK

Both SDKs and the event-camera driver can be downloaded and installed from their respective websites:

[Metavision SDK (Make sure to download version 4.4.0 or greater!)](https://files.prophesee.ai/share/dists/public/windows/baiTh5si/)\
[SilkyEvCam EvC3A driver (This is required to interface with our specific camera)](https://centuryarks.com/en/download/)\
[Basler's Pylon SDK (Download the latest version of the software suite)](https://www2.baslerweb.com/en/downloads/software-downloads/)
